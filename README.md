Make Bookmarklet
================

Overview
--------

Converts a JavaScript file into a `javascript:` URL that can be used as a [bookmarklet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet). The resulting bookmarklet is inserted into the current file as a comment on the first line for reference or to copy out later. It is also immediately copied to the clipboard.

This is an unabasehed rip-off of [John Gruber's Perl version](http://daringfireball.net/2007/03/javascript_bookmarklet_builder), just made to work natively in Sublime Text.

Usage
-----

From the Command Pallete, search for `Make Bookmarklet`.
Or, under the menu `Tools > Make Bookmarklet`.
